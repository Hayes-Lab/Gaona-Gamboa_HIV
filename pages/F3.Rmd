        <li>A ) Heatmap expression of the microglia signature gene set defined by Gosselin et.al., 2017 in CSF and peripheral blood derived myeloid and lymphoid cells. </li> 
       
        <li>B ) Heatmap expression of brain border associate macrophage markers in CSF and peripheral blood derived myeloid and lymphoid cells. </li>
        
        <li>C ) Heatmap expression of genes enriched in the CSF compartment. </li>
        
       <li>D ) Unbiased identification of gene modules enriched based on compartment (CSF vs PBMC) or based on cell type (lymphoid vs myeloid).Color represents correlation coefficient and value inside each square is the p-value for significant association. </li>
       
       <li>E ) Genes in the brown module are enriched in CSF myeloid cells, while genes in the black module are enriched in the CSF compartment across both myeloid and lymphoid cells. </li>
       
       <li>F ) Gene set enrichment analysis of the black and brown module genes using biological processes and molecular pathways.
